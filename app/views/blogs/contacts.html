			<span class="center_h1"> Meet Keenan </span>
		</h1>

		<div class="ruby_info"> My name is Keenan John Robert Sturtevant. Keenan represents my Grandmothers maiden name. John is my Grandpa's name. Robert is my Mothers Dad's name. And Sturtevant represents my Fathers last name (naturally). My name represents all sides of my family. I am a collection of many things, names being one of them. Honesty, Integrety, Leadership, Work Ethic, Kindness, and Love are some more. Like my name, I am a lot of different things bundeled into one.

		<p> I have been told that I have an old wise soul, and I take that as a complement. However, I too am a young soul. Filled with idea and hope for the future of this world. The Old Soul, collective mind, and experienced person that I am has seen more than most people have ever seen. I have been on the most amazing adventures to the most amazing places in the world. I have see the most amazing people, both good and bad. And I have taken not of it.

		<p> I have had an amazing life so far, with a few bumps here and there that keeps things interesting. Because I have had such a blessed life, done so much, seen so much, been so much, I plan to give back to the world that has givin to me. My goal with what I am doing here at DBC, it to learn the skills needed to change the world and all who inhabit it. The first part of my plan is provide education, true education not memorization, to people who want it. Only after people become educated can we start to fix this world.

		
		<p> I am a man of many things, goals included. So because you are reading this, just know that I am so serious about everything I say and do. People tend to not believe me at first, but after a while they become believers. 

		<p> Would you like to change the world with me?
